            .NET Core Tools Telemetry
        </h3>
        <p>
            The .NET Core Tools include a telemetry feature that collects usage information. It is important that the .NET Team understands how the tools are being used so that we can improve them.

        <p>
            The .NET Core Tools telemetry feature is enabled by default. You can opt-out of the telemetry feature by setting an environment variable DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT (for example, 'export' on macOS/Linux, 'set' on Windows) to true (for example, 'true', 1).
